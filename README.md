# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, we used Excel to conduct analyses on a data set containing information about various Kickstarter campaigns.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to determine how to most effectively conduct a fundraising campaign through Kickstarter so that Louise was best positioned to run a successful campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The data set contained information on over 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns. The data set started with 14 categories of information about each campaign, and we used these categories to derive several additional categories during our analysis. The challenges faced included sorting and filtering this large data set, combining and viewing the data in different ways to better understand it, and creating visualizations to effectively convey the insights generated through the data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart displayed below compares the success, failure and cancelation rates of Theater-based Kickstarter campaigns according to the month the campaigns were launched:

As evidenced by the graph, May and June have large numbers of successful launches. There are slightly more failed launches in May than in June, but there are also more launches overall in May. Based on this data, it is advisable to launch Theater campaigns in May or June, as Kickstarters beginning in these months experience the highest success rates. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This chart examines the success rate of Kickstarter campaigns with regard to the "Goal," i.e. the amount of money sought by the campaign:

 The date shown here represents the campaigns in the subcategory "plays."  For example, for the campaigns that sought $25,000 - $29,999, about 80% failed, and about 20% were successful. According to this graph, the highest success rate came for those campaigns seeking $1,000 or less. The success rate is higher than the failure rate up until $14,999, at which point the failure rate starts to exceed the success rate. Interestingly, the success rate exceeds the failure rate from $35,000 to $44,999. 
 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The primary challenges were deciding which parts of the data set to filter so that it included information most relevant to Louise's campaign, and deciding which new categories of data to create in order to gain beneficial insights into past campaign strategies.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. August through April would probably be the worst months for Louise to launch a campaign. 
2. May through July are the best months to launch a campaign. May is the best month overall to launch a campaign. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

For the greatest chance of a successful campaign, Louise should keep her fundraising goal to under $15,000. After $15,000, there is a drastic increase in the amount of campaigns that fail. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This data set does not account for qualitative measures. For example, the success rate of a campaign may have something to do with the way the description of the project is written on Kickstarter, or with the likability/reputation of the person running the campaign.  The data does not give us insight into these factors that are difficult to measure. 

Another limitation is that there is no data relating to campaigns within countries.  We can see the amount of campaigns in the US, but there may be differing success rates in specific regions of the US.  The data does not provide us with this information. 



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

There are many lenses through which this data could continue to be analyzed. For example, we could create graphs that compare the success rate of theater campaigns with whether or not the campaign was a staff pick. We could look at whether the goal amount correlates with correlates with the number of backers or the average donation. We could look at whether different parent categories or subcategories were more likely to be staff picks. There are many more ways to analyze this large data set in order to derive insights about Kickstarter campaigns.
